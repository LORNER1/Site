            <h3>Historical Evolution of Version Control Systems</h3>
            <p>The evolution of VCS spans several decades, with distinct generations of tools marking key milestones.
Early systems were centralized, relying on a single repository server, while later systems introduced
distributed collaboration. Below is a timeline of major milestones in VCS history, from the 1970s to
today, illustrating this evolution</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS) – one of the first version control systems, developed
at Bell Labs, which introduced the basic idea of tracking changes (initially used on IBM
mainframes). 
</li>
            <li>1982: <b>Revision Control System (RCS)</b> – released by Walter Tichy at Purdue University, RCS
automated change tracking for individual files using delta storage (storing differences between
file versions) . RCS was a local VCS (no network support), handling one file at a time.</li>
            <li>1986: <b>Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</b> – developed by Dick Grune as a front-end to RCS, CVS
allowed collaboration on whole projects with a client-server model . It added networked
repositories and concurrent multi-developer capabilities to RCS.</li>
            <li>2000: <b>Subversion (SVN)</b> – created by CollabNet as a successor to CVS, Subversion improved on
CVS’s weaknesses. SVN introduced atomic commits (all-or-nothing changesets), better handling
of file renames, and more efficient network operations</li>
            <li>2005: <b>Git and Mercurial</b> – a breakthrough year for version control. In 2005, after the Linux
kernel’s commercial VCS (BitKeeper) license was revoked, Linus Torvalds created Git as a new
distributed VCS for the kernel</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Around the same time, Matt Mackall released Mercurial. Both
Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems (DVCS)</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>
